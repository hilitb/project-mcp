# .project directory gitignore
# Keep this file to ensure .project is tracked but can exclude sensitive items

# Don't ignore anything by default - we want to track project management files
# But you can add patterns here if needed for your specific project

# Example: Ignore draft thoughts that aren't ready to be tracked
# thoughts/drafts/

# Example: Ignore work-in-progress files
# *.wip.md
